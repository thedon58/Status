Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have most of the fundamentals of the game in place and it works fairly well. I have added the logos of different schools around the Philly area with Stella shooting at them from the bottom.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to find sound effects to add into the game for hits, shooting, and game wins/losses. I would also like to randomize the order than the "invaders" attack Stella and difficulty level option on the home page.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have not hit a ton of problems, but I would like to add in the things listed above, but I would like to add them without the aid of finding it on GitHub or Youtube. I am confident though that I will accomplish anything and everything I set out to do on this project.
